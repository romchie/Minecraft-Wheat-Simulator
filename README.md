## Minecraft Wheat Simulator (v1.0)
This is a Python programming exercise using a class to make a text-based representation of growing wheat [as done in the popular video game Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZTZjiny1E0&ab_channel=DylanLight55). The simulation prompts you to plant the seeds, and once they've been planted, the growing process begins. 

### Note
For the sake of saving time and simply showcasing the fundamentals of the simulation, the longest amount of time between stages of growth is 5 seconds.


### Running the Simulation
Once you cd into the repo, type the following python command to run the simulation.

	python3 mcWheatSim.py

### Potential Future Changes
I soon plan on adding the ability to actually harvest wheat and accumulate bushels of wheat. I may even consider adding the ability to sell wheat and buy upgrades to wheat production, at which case the program essentially migrates into a farming econ simulator.
